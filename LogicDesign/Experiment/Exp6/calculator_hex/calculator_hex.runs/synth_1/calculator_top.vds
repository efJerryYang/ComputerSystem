These constraints will be read post-synthesis (as long as their source constraint file is marked as used_in_implementation) and should be applied correctly then. You should review the constraints listed in the file [.Xil/calculator_top_propImpl.xdc] and check the run log file to verify that these constraints were correctly applied.
INFO: [Project 1-236] Implementation specific constraints were found while reading constraint file [E:/GitHub/ComputerSystem/LogicDesign/Experiment/Exp6/calculator_hex/calculator_hex.srcs/constrs_1/imports/Exp_Packages/Exp_general.xdc]. These constraints will be ignored for synthesis but will be used in implementation. Impacted constraints are listed in the file [.Xil/calculator_top_propImpl.xdc].
Resolution: To avoid this warning, move constraints listed in [.Xil/calculator_top_propImpl.xdc] to another XDC file and exclude this new file from synthesis with the used_in_synthesis property (File Properties dialog in GUI) and re-run elaboration/synthesis.
