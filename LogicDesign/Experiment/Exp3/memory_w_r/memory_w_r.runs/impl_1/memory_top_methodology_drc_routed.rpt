2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net clk_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): clk_IBUF_inst/O, u_clk_div/clk_in1, u_memory_w_r/clk
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell u_memory_w_r/cnt_1s[26]_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) u_memory_w_r/clk_1s_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#1 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin flag_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin u_led_mem/U0/inst_blk_mem_gen/gnbram.gnativebmg.native_blk_mem_gen/valid.cstr/ramloop[0].ram.r/prim_noinit.ram/DEVICE_7SERIES.NO_BMM_INFO.SP.WIDE_PRIM18.ram/CLKARDCLK is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#3 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin u_led_mem/U0/inst_blk_mem_gen/gnbram.gnativebmg.native_blk_mem_gen/valid.cstr/ramloop[0].ram.r/prim_noinit.ram/DEVICE_7SERIES.NO_BMM_INFO.SP.WIDE_PRIM18.ram/CLKBWRCLK is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#4 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin u_memory_w_r/addr_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#5 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin u_memory_w_r/addr_reg[1]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#6 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin u_memory_w_r/addr_reg[2]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#7 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin u_memory_w_r/addr_reg[3]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#8 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin u_memory_w_r/ena_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#9 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin u_memory_w_r/flag_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#10 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin u_memory_w_r/wea_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock u_clk_div/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin u_clk_div/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>
